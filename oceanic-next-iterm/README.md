## 256 Colors only

This theme is updated to work with only 256 color. Iterm2 has support for 256 colors, as well as True Colors in the nightly builds.

## Oceanic Vim color scheme

If you're also using my [Oceanic-next colorscheme](https://github.com/mhartington/oceanic-next) in regular vim, you'll want to use this iterm colorscheme. Vim uses the anis colors from the terminal settings and that interferes with the color scheme.
