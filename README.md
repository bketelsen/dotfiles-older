If you're not curl bash'ing are you even a real developer?
```
curl  -sSL https://git.io/bketelsen | bash
```

## creating curl bash
Use git.io or your favorite shortener and point to the bootstrap/setup script in your dotfiles repo:
```
curl -i https://git.io -F "url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bketelsen/dotfiles/master/setup.sh" -F code=bketelsen
```
